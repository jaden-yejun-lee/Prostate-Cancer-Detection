# Prostate-Cancer-Detection

## Introduction
Ever since Machine Learning became a buzzword, cancer diagnosis using machine learning models has been a goal of young, beginning data analysts. Not only is it a task with high applicability in the medical field, it would also be a task perfect for applying all the skills we’ve developed during this course. As a binary classification task, we would be able to apply many different techniques and have a final comparison of the models we’ve learned in this course. 

## Problem Definition
We are looking to predict whether a prostate has cancer or if it is benign. We will mainly be using a Prostate Cancer Dataset of 100 patients about appearance and texture as features for this prediction. 

This is a supervised learning binary classification task since we are trying to find out if it is benign or malignant. The expected inputs are a set of values for the 8 numerical features (Radius, Texture, Perimeter, Area, Smoothness, Compactness, Symmetry, Fractal Dimension). The predicted Diagnosis is encoded as 0 or 1 based on the training model.
